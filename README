- to close a server you have to Ctrl + C on the putty

5. Start the client in another puTTy/host ./chatClient2


 

 - It will ask you to type in the port number of the chat server
 - if there is no port numbers then there is none that are open
 - that you would like to join and then ask for a username and make sure that there is no one else in the chat with that name

 -Ctrl C for a client to leave

 

6. Remember to kill the servers and the directory before logging off.
