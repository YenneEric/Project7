1. Copy the files to your own directory.

2. Modify inet.h to reflect the host you are currently logged into.
   Also, modify the port numbers to be used to reduce the likelihood
   of conflicting with another server.

3. Compile the source code using the command: make

4. Start the directory server in the background: ./directoryServer5 &

  4.1. Start one or more chat servers: in either the same or another shell: ./chatServer5 "nameofserver" portnumber (don't put & at the end -  
  keep this process foregrounded in its own shell)

  !!!
     The only allowed values for nameofserver are "KSUFootball" and "MovieTalk"
     since these two are the only ones with available certificates to use
  !!!

  - There can be a max of 10 servers but only 2 certificates are available in this version
  - To close a server, interrupt it using Ctrl+C 

5. Start the client in another shell: ./chatClient5

  - It will ask you to type in the port number of the chat server you would like to join
  - If there are no servers listed, you will first need to create one using the directions in step 4.1.
  - Otherwise, it will then ask for a username
     - Make sure that there is no one else in the chat with that name, otherwise the client program will be stopped, 
       and you will need to restart it.

  - Use Ctrl+C to exit a client session

6. Remember to kill the servers and the directory before logging off.

  - To close the directory use the command: pkill directoryServer -u $USER
