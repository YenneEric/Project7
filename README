1. Copy the files to your own directory.

2. Modify inet.h to reflect the host you are currently logged into.
   Also, modify the port numbers to be used to reduce the likelihood
   of conflicting with another server.

3. Compile the source code using the command: make

4. Start the directory servers in the background: ./directoryServer5 &;


 in either the same or different puTTY/host ./chatServer5 "nameofserver" portnumber  (don't put & at the end)

!!!
 the only allowed name of servers are "KSUFootball" and "MovieTalk"
 this is because we have created this certificates before 
 !!!

-./chatServer "nameofserver" portnumber    the server has to be created like this to work
- there can be a max of 10 servers but only 2 have the certificates pre 
- to close a server you have to Ctrl + C on the putty

5. Start the client in another puTTy/host ./chatClient5


 

 - It will ask you to type in the port number of the chat server
 - if there is no port numbers then there is none that are open
 - that you would like to join and then ask for a username and make sure that there is no one else in the chat with that name

 -Ctrl C for a client to leave

 

6. Remember to kill the servers and the directory before logging off.

- To close the directory you will have to type ps 
 and then kill<Pid> of the server
